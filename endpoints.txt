The following is the required data according to me as of now:-

1) Cleaning ID (Affiliated with date and time of cleaning)
2) Cleaning team ID (Affiliated with names/ID's of cleaning staff responsible for the cleaning)
3) Cleaning rating (on a scale of 1 to 5)
4) Floor number  an which the cleaning staff is that day.
5) List of rooms having been cleaned that day. (for cleaning map)

I will also need to request all the valid Cleaner ID's, so as to check if the qr code is valid. 
Either this, or I will send you the code I scan, you run the comparison in the backend, and return me a boolean or something.


The following is the data I will be sending to the backend server everytime a cleaning takes place:-

1) Student ID data. (Including room number, roll number)
2) The Cleaner Team ID (from the QR code scanned)
3) The rating for the particular cleaning.

You can extrapolate data like floor number from the room number.

I don't know how this translates to endpoints. But I guess you can figure those out based on these requirements.
